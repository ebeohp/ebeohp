# phoebe -- @ebehop
Hello, I'm Phoebe a high schooler interested in pursuing CS. Previously, I had no coding experience (not counting Scratch!) up until 9th grade which was a real door opener for me. Now, I'm brainstorming and programming html5 games for a non-profit called Keep Sugar Land Beautiful. 🌳🐸 I also intend to learn frameworks like Vue and continue to learn data structures on youtoob :>
